# Green Chain Challenge! - Find a friend - API üê∂

This is the API of the FindAFriend project, which aims to connect people interested in adopting pets to organizations that make pets available for adoption. The API is responsible for providing the necessary data for the web application to work correctly.

To use the application, you need to run both the server and the web application. Follow the instructions below to set up the API, then download and run the web application available in the repository at: [Find A Friend Web](https://github.com/leandrorodrigues00/gcc-find-a-friend-web).
